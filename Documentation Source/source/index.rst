This is the documentation for building a nosepoke for rat behavioral experiments. 
This project was developed by Andy Lustig in the `Karpova Lab <https://www.janelia.org/lab/karpova-lab>`_ at Janelia Research Campus.

Features
----------

- **Useful interface for rat**

  - Controllable overhead LED for lighting up the inside of the nosepoke
  - Infrared beam break for detecting nose insertion
  - Shelf for liquid reward to accumulate instead of dripping onto floor

- **Easy installation and maintenance**

  - Designed to be press fit into 1.5" hole for easy installation and removal
  - Backside push-to-connect tube fitting for quick connection/disconnection when replacing liquid reward tubing

- **Robust and manufacturable**

  - Designed to be machined out of hard plastic by a typical machine shop. A less durable version could be 3D printed
  - Zero exposed wires, all connections are integrated in the PCB or made with solder joints. 

    - Removes possiblity of connections coming loose or wires becoming damaged over time
  - Electronics can be easily scaled to larger quantities
    
    - Single sided PCB with surface mount components is ideal for a PCB assembly service or manual assembly with a toaster oven/hot plate/heat gun


- **Open source**

  - All files are available on `GitHub <:github_url: https://github.com/Karpova-Lab/nosepoke>`_  and can be modified to meet custom needs
